                <h1>A little about me.</h1>
                <p>Hiya! I’m Esther Timpson - a client-centered designer and lover of beautiful products.

                    I’m passionate about creating a delightful experience in every user interaction. I believe that the small details can make the biggest impact and that a well-thought out design is what brings a product to the next level. It’s important to me to personally connect with the product I am working on, and I am driven by products that I know are making a positive impact in the world. 
                    
                    As a previous health professional, my personal passions are to my physical, mental, and spiritual health. When I’m not designing, I spend my time in the outdoors - hiking, playing sports, or just enjoying the sound of wind rustling through the trees. 
                    I’m always up for a collaboration - reach out and let’s chat!
